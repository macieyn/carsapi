# Rules & hints

1. Your goal is to implement REST API in Django, however, you're free to use any third-party libraries and database of your choice, but please share your reasoning behind choosing them.
2. Remember to name endpoints and fields exactly as in examples - your admission will be at one point tested automatically!
3. Please do not paginate /popular and /cars responses.
4. Make sure your API is accessible over HTTP
5. At least basic tests of endpoints and their functionality are obligatory. Show us how good unit tests should look like!
6. The application's code should be kept in a public repository so that we can read it, pull it and build it ourselves. Remember to include README file or at least basic notes on application requirements and setup - we should be able to easily and quickly get it running.
7. Please dockerize your application and use docker-compose or a similar solution.
8. Written application must be hosted and publicly available for us online - we recommend Heroku.
